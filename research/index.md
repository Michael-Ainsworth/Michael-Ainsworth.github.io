## Research
\


#### Precision Care Medicine (2020) - In Progress!

Created machine learning models to identify hemodynamic features that can predict negative stroke outcomes using real patient data. Goal of research is to reliably flag at-risk patients using features commonly available for hospitalized stroke victims. Worked in a small team under the guidence of clinicians.

Skills involved:

* Python
* Scikit-learn
* SQL
* GitHub

___
\

#### Neuro Data Design (2020) - In Progress!

Analyzed the relationship between non-parametric Random Forest models and parametric Deep Networks. Helped find a data distribution that demonstrates the converging nature of non-parametric models at computationally feasible, large sample sizes.

Skills involved:

* Python
* Model-based statistics
* Scikit-learn
* GitHub

___
\

#### Burke Neurological Institute (2018)

Assisted in the development of a study testing the effects of 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP) on spinal cord injury patients. Conducted behavioral testing on a cohort of eight rats to determine long-term effects of 4-AP paired with forelimb supination training. Discovered a positive correlation between 4-AP and motor learning over an eight-week training period. For more information, check out [work experience](http://michaelainsworth.me/workExperience).

Skills involved:

* Experimental Design
* Data Analytics
* Public Speaking/Presenting

___
\

#### Burke Neurological Institute (2017)

Worked with Nikon Eclipse TI-S microscope and Neurolucida software to analyze rat brain affected by internal capsule stroke. Assisted in the creation of an image morphing software using Python and Matlab to better quantify brain images. Prepared and presented on novel methods of quantifying forelimb-specific internal capsule lesions using motor mapping. For more information, check out [work experience](http://michaelainsworth.me/workExperience).

Skills involved:

* Python
* Neurolucida
* Data Analytics
* Public Speaking/Presenting
