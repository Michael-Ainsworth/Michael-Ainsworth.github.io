## Welcome to my Homepage!

My name is Michael Ainsworth.

I am a graduate student currently living in Baltimore, Maryland, where I attend Johns Hopkins University. I am studying Biomedical Engineering with a focus in Biomedical Data Science.

I am interested in applying machine learning techniques to uncover underlying patterns in data and using my engineering background to discover real-world solutions. I have experience working on design teams and in project development environments. I am passionate about collaborating with others and applying critical thinking skills to unique problems.
